                    <p>The protests initially began in late 2020 against three new farm laws passed by the Indian government, which aimed to liberalize the agricultural sector by allowing farmers to sell their produce directly to private buyers and enter into contract farming agreements.</p>
                    <p>Farmers, particularly from Punjab and Haryana states, feared that these laws would leave them vulnerable to exploitation by corporations and undermine the existing system of government-regulated markets, known as mandis. They demanded the repeal of the laws and legal guarantees for minimum support prices (MSP) for their crops.</p>
                    <p>The protests gained widespread attention both nationally and internationally and became one of the largest and most prolonged farmer movements in India's history. They involved massive demonstrations, sit-ins, road blockades, and negotiations with the government. Despite several rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions, no resolution was reached for a considerable time.</p>
